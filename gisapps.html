  <h5 class="h5text">Simple Inventory Script for "Spatial Properties Inc."</h5>
  
  <p> "One issue Spatial Properties Inc. has had until now is properly maintaining and managing their data, 
    which is why they are looking to move everything into a centralized database. They currently use 
    shapefiles and Excel files for almost everything, and it iss always a mess keeping track of what they have. 
    To that end, they have requested a sample script for doing a quick inventory on a folder to get some 
    basic information." </p>
    <p><h5 class="h5text">Script Requirements</h5>	
      <ul>
      <li>The script should take an input folder as a workspace.</li>
      <li>It should count and report the total number of shapefiles, and the total number of Excel files, in the workspace; Spatial Properties Inc. is not interested in other types of files at this time.</li>
      <li>For each shapefile or Excel file, it should count and report the total number of rows or features.</li>
      <li>As Spatial Properties Inc is interested in harmonizing columns for their Property and Customer Location data, the script should also list and report the fields for any point shapefiles; line and polygon shapefiles should not have their fields reported.</li>

  <p> "The President of Spatial Properties Inc. recently heard about the geodatabase ability to attach photos to 
    points and has become very excited at the prospect of being able to look at photos of their recent trip to 
    Italy using ArcGIS Pro. As such, a request has been made for a smaller script to help the President get 
    their photos organized for this purpose." </p>

    <p><h5 class="h5text">Script Requirements</h5>	
      <ul>
      <li> The script should use the folder containing the photos as its workspace.</li>
      <li> It should create a new file geodatabase in that workspace using the Create File GDB tool.</li>
      <li> It should then call the GeoTagged Photos To Points tool with the following settings:</li>
      <li> The input folder should be the same folder as the workspace.</li>
      <li> The output feature class should be created in the geodatabase created earlier.</li>
      <li> The script should not import photos that are not geotagged.</li>
      <li> The script should add imported photos as attachments.</li>

  <h5 class="h5text">Convert GPS Text Files to Feature Classess in a File Geodatabase</h5>
  
  <p> "At one point, Spatial Properties Inc. had plans to do their name justice by equipping every employee 
    with a GPS device to allow them to keep track of their movements, the idea being to eventually use 
    spatial analysis to increase efficiency. That never transpired, but as part of their current work, the 
    company would like to look at processing some of that data into a spatial format for future work in this 
    area. They have requested a script from you to help them convert their GPS text files to feature classes 
    in a file geodatabase." </p>

    <p><h5 class="h5text">Script Requirements</h5>	
      <ul>
      <li> The script should take an input folder as a workspace.</li>
      <li> It should create a new file geodatabase in that workspace called Realtor_Tracks.</li>
      <li> It should create a new feature dataset within the file geodatabase called Realtors.</li>
      <li> The dataset should use the same NAD83 UTM Zone 12 projection as the GPS devices.</li>
      <li> Then, for every text file in the workspace, it should:</li>
      <li> Create a feature class inside the feature dataset with the same name as the text file.</li>
      <li> Read the coordinates from the file and insert them as points into the new FC
        .</li>

  <h5 class="h5text">Reducing Redundancy</h5>
  
  <p> "The little bit of GIS work that Spatial Properties Inc. has done in the past has been with shapefiles, and 
    as a result, theyâ€™ve created a lot of redundancy. Rather than one shapefile for each specific type of data, the company recognizes that they can use a 
    smaller number of feature classes, and leverage subtypes to achieve the exact same result." </p>

    <p><h5 class="h5text">Script Requirements</h5>	
      <ul>
      <li> Take an input workspace that is the folder containing the shapefiles.</li>
      <li> Create a file geodatabase in the folder that has the same name as the folder.</li>
      <li> Inside the file geodatabase, create a feature class with the following specifications:</li>
      <li> The name should be the same as the folder name.</li>
      <li> You can assume each feature class is a POINT feature class.</li>
      <li> The spatial reference can be acquired from any of the shapefiles in that folder.</li>
      <li> Add a field called TYPECODE to this feature class of type SHORT, then set it as the subtype field for the feature class.</li>
      <li> Establish a counter variable, and then for each shapefile in the folder:</li>
      <li> Add a subtype to the previously created feature class, where the subtype code is the 
        current value of the counter, and the subtype name corresponds to the shapefile name 
        scrubbed of the extension and the folder name (e.g. the subtype created from 
        MajorClientsAtlantic.shp should just be called Atlantic, scrubbed of the .shp extension 
        and the MajorClients folder name).</li>
      <li> Open a search cursor on the shapefile SHAPE@XY token.</li>
      <li>  Open an insert cursor on the previously created feature class for both the SHAPE@XY 
        token and the TYPECODE field.</li>
      <li> For each row in the search cursor, insert its SHAPE@XY token and the current value of 
        the counter variable.</li>
      <li>  Increment the counter so that the next shapefile adds a new subtype and inserts its 
        records into the new subtype.</li>
      <li> The feature class should also have properly named subtypes corresponding to the number of shapefiles 
        that were in the source folder.</li>
      <li> The data should also be loaded into the correct subtypes based on which shapefile in the folder they 
        originated from.</li>
    </ul>
