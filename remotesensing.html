  <p><em><strong>Note.</strong></em> LiDAR Point Cloud Analysis using a 1km2 test site, mixed agricultural and forested/reforested land, located outside Bailieboro, Ontario, Canada. Image A (DTM) and image B (DSM) were derived from an elevation-classified LiDAR Point Cloud dataset, sourced from the Ontario GeoHub, acquired from April to May 2017, using a Leica ALS70-HP sensor. Images A and B are symbolized using ArcGIS Pro V3.0.2 shaded relief symbology. Image C displays an aerial Orthophotography multispectral image (R/G/B/NIR), acquired from April 26th to May 7th, 2013. Using an ADS80 Leica digital Pushbroom sensor, 20-meter resolution, sourced from the Ontario GeoHub. LiDAR DTM was created using “Ground” detected LiDAR points and completed using LAS Dataset to Raster tool (Triangulation interpolation/Natural Neighbors), with an output cell size of 0.5 meters. LiDAR DSM was created using 1st returns and non-noise filtered points, using the LAS Dataset to Raster tool (Binning interpolation, cell assignment-Maximum), and setting the processing extent and snap raster to the DTM, with an output cell size of 0.5 meters. Note that the DTM and DSM can be viewed in 3-D using ChromaDepth glasses to enhance visualization. </p>

  <p><em><strong>Note.</strong></em> This is an orthorectified CIR photograph captured in Milton, Ontario, Canada on June 10, 1997 (Scale: 1:20,000). The photograph is displayed as a standard false colour composite, overlain with a yellow road network, and underlain with 2002 orthophotography in true colour. The orthorectification process began with fiducial mark collection to capture the local image coordinates, followed by scanned-film camera calibration and setting the image projection to UTM zone 17T NAD83. Manual and automatic GCP collection was performed to ensure the orthorectification is within an acceptable RMS error range of X RMS: 0.392, Y RMS: 0.431, and Z RMS: 2.791. Comparing the orthorectified image to the road network, we observed an accurate depiction of the correct lanes. The leaf-on period image was captured with an A Wild RC10 film camera with a Universal Aviogon II lens, 40cm resolution, 16-bit, NRG (NIR, red, green bands) in JPEG2000 format (53 MB/Tile). The digital conversion occurred in 2006. The MNR, Southern Ontario collected the images from the Ontario GeoHub. The orthorectification process was performed using CATALYST Professional OrthoEngine. </p>

  <p><em><strong>Note.</strong></em> This 3-D stereo-pair was created from two CIR aerial images, captured with an A Wild RC10 film camera and a Universal Aviogon II lens, on June 10, 1997, in Milton, Ontario, Canada. The images, in NRG (NIR, red, green bands) JPEG2000 format with 40cm resolution and 16-bit, were obtained from the Ontario GeoHub and collected by the MNR, Southern Ontario. Digital conversion was completed in 2006. These images were taken during the leaf-on period and have an approximate scale of 1:10000. They were used to generate the 3-D stereo-pair, which provides a three-dimensional effect by displaying two images taken from slightly different angles. This stereoscopy effect allows the brain to process the differences between the two images. </p>
