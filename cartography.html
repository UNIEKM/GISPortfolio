  <p> This map provides an overview of the distribution of wildland fires in Canada, specifically focusing on fires that have grown to a final size of 200 hectares or greater. 
    Canada is home to 9% of the world's forests, and it has been estimated that an average of 2.5 million hectares are burned annually. 
    While only 3% of all wildland fires exceed 200 hectares in size, they account for a staggering 97% of the total area burned in the country. 
    Despite wildland fires being a natural occurrence within forest ecosystems, their impact on the economy cannot be overlooked, with annual fire suppression costs ranging from 800 million to 1.5 billion over the last decade.

    <div class="subtitles2"><p><em><strong>Southern Nevada, United States of America</strong></em></p></div>
    <p> Area 51 is a highly classified and remote United States Air Force facility located within the Nevada Test and Training Range. It is situated approximately 83 miles (134 kilometers) north-northwest of Las Vegas, near the small town of Rachel, Nevada. The facility is surrounded by vast desert terrain and the Groom Lake dry lake bed, which contributes to its secrecy and isolation. Area 51 is primarily known for its association with top-secret military research, experimental aircraft, and numerous conspiracy theories, particularly those related to UFOs and extraterrestrial life.
    </p>
    <p> Bob Lazar, a contentious figure, rose to prominence in 1989 when he asserted that he had worked on reverse-engineering extraterrestrial technology at S-4, a site near Area 51. Lazar described nine flying saucers stored in hangars and claimed to have been involved with an advanced propulsion system using the then-unknown Element 115 (now identified as Moscovium). While his story captivated many, it also drew skepticism due to a lack of verifiable evidence and discrepancies in his educational and professional background. Despite these concerns, Lazar's account has significantly contributed to the Area 51 narrative, sparking an ongoing fascination with the base's potential connections to UFOs and extraterrestrial technology, as evidenced by numerous documentaries, books, and articles on the subject (Jacobsen, A., 2011).
